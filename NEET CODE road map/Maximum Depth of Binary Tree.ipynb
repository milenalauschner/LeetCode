    "\n",
    "Python uses “dunder methods” (double underscore) for special behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__ → constructor (initialization).\n",
    "\n",
    "__str__ → how to represent the object as a string (print(obj)).\n",

    "val just means “value” of the node.\n",
    "\n",
